> Ok, if you made your way till here you are definitely intrested in Programing. But Where Should Someone Go? You Know `Java`, `C++`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Python` and Much More But what to do next, which language should You Choose? Lets Find Out. 

Look, I had the same Problem. Let me tell you the solution.

1. **Stop Learning new Languages** from Now.
1. Learn Any **framework** (important), I had learnt Laravel. This will help you to be professional and Accurate.
1. Think of any Minor ( Suggested ) or Major Project, Make it. I luckily got a paid project for an online shopping cart with multiauth and an admin panel to manage inventory and orders.
1. Built it and Create a Screen Recording of it, Put it on Youtube **to Showcase not to earn** from it. Open-source everything on GitHub.
1. Your subs dosen't count, Just **keep uploading Small Projects**.
1. Take inspiration from other projects rebuild it, **Screen Record it, Upload it**.
1. Once you had Great Collection, Take Opportunity and showcase it whenever you had chance like i am going to do here. [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkEnvADVlUvB5vx3oB14w0cRPf3Sf5anR](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkEnvADVlUvB5vx3oB14w0cRPf3Sf5anR)
1. Do what you enjoy, Once anyone recognise your work, You will get connected and Get a minor freelance project, Do it. Get some Cash.
1. Just keep Updating yourself daily, don't ever sit freely, Keep thinking of small projects and keep doing it. I think money dosen't count much at your age ( i don't know what's your age is ) untill your parents are supporting you.
If you're in collage, You'll get Placed easily because of your practical knowledge so Don't worry regarding Your Placement ðŸ˜‰.
1. Enjoy your life, Just wait for right opportunity. Until this Keep Doing What you love. **(must be coding )**.


### Some of the minor/major projects I will suggest you.

1. Scrap web for multiple reasons, I had scraped https://wallpaperscraft.com and As this has categories, I had made a System in which you just need to type a category and it will scrap all the wallpapers from 100+ pages. You could have 1000+ wallpapers just by entering category I placed the code on a server, Ran it, made a zip there and downloaded. It was that simple but **felt like i had some magic powers.**

It takes 3-4 Clicks for anyone to get A full hd wallpaper but **after your code**, you could get everything in just a click. PM me for this project details, I'll give you Hint and Help you to make a yt video for fun ( not to earn ).

Watch my yt projects and You can literally copy any of mine/anyone's project easily. but copy means copying project ideas, not code.
**IB me for more Project ideas**, i have tons. Literally A lot of ideas related to any of languages ( mostly python and php ) you know even if you know basics.

Example:- Make a file encoder/decoder in C++(Looks hard but need not more then 30 lines of code). 

> Its definitely not paid and i'll not even look at your code, if you stuck, i can help.

### Be Positive and everything will go Your way.
